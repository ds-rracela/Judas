JUDAS with Radar  - Jude's Automated System with Rad's Changes

## Description
Machine learning library that utilizes different scikit learn machine learning models which make it easier for users to evaluate the model in different algorithm.

It uses the following:  

**Classification**
* kNN
* Logistic (l1)
* Logistic (l2)
* Linear SVM (l1)
* Linear SVM (l2)
* Nonlinear SVM (RBF)
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting Method

**Regression**
* kNN
* Linear
* Lasso
* Ridge
* Linear SVM
* SVR (rbf)
* SVR (poly)
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting Method

It also features a summary table and a graphs to show the behavior for every parameter.
